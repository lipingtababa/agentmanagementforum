The Agent Management Forum editorial team brings together practitioners, researchers, and builders working at the frontier of AI agent management. We curate articles that help teams navigate the complexities of deploying, orchestrating, and governing autonomous AI agents in production environments.

Our focus areas include multi-agent coordination patterns, human-in-the-loop workflows, agent observability, safety guardrails, and the emerging organisational structures needed to manage AI agent fleets at scale.
